# Logistic growth simulation of an *Escherichia coli*
This is a repository containing the code to simulate the growth of an isolate of the bacterium *Escherichia coli* in a test tube containing 1ml of growth medium.
<br>
We are looking to estimate the initial population size of the bacterial population, rate of growth and the carrying capacity from experimental data.
<br>
The experimental data used to simulate this growth comes from the 'experiment1.csv' file.
